When updating the portfolio project
- Always check if the README.md needs updates after making changes
- Update the README when adding new features, sections, or significant modifications
- Keep the tech stack information current
- Update project structure documentation if files are added or removed
- Refresh feature list when new functionality is implemented
- Maintain accurate browser support information
- Update maintenance notes with any new requirements or processes
- Always ensure proper color contrast between text/icons and their background colors
- Never use the same color for both icon and background (e.g., both using var(--primary-color))
- Use specific Tailwind color classes for better visibility when needed
